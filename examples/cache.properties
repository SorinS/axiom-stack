# cache.properties
# 
# Axiom has a built in caching mechanism. To use it drop a cache.properties file in the desired prototype's folder. Here's an example: 
#
# main = 600
# main.mode = response
#
# In this example "main" is the method we wish to cache. The first line defines how long the cache will live in seconds. The second line 
# defines the caching mode to use for this method. 
#
# There are two valid settings for the mode: response and method. 
# 
# response
# Caches the entire response and is the most effective. 
#
# method 
# Is used for caching the results of a tal file. This can help when you can't cache the entire response. 
#
# Important Note: This will only work for what any given method returns. If your method writes directly to 
# the response (res.write), then it won't be cached.
